        <textarea id="textbox" rows="7" cols="60"> Having learned the elements from the four great masters, Aang makes one final trip to seek out the advice of the mysterious guru. As the guru guides Aang on his path to spiritual enlightenment, the words of the masters ring in Aang's head: a, b, c, d. As Aang does some inspecting of what he has learned on the various episodes on his journey, the guru explains to him that there is only one thing left to learn before he can face the fire lord. What does the guru tell Aang?</textarea>

    <!-------------------------------------- WATER -------------------------------------------------
        [Angrily.] I knew it! [Accusingly points a finger at Aang as he and Katara draw closer.] 
        You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

    <!-------------------------------------- EARTH -------------------------------------------------
        [Sharply.] I'm well aware! Your eyes and tattoos glow and you're able to summon 
        unbelievable power. Without you, we'd be slaughtered before we even reach their shores. 
        [Looks at map and guides finger from the location of the base to the location of the Fire 
        Nation Capital.] But with you leading the way, as the ultimate weapon, we could cut a 
        swath right through to the heart of the Fire Nation

    <!--------------------------------------- FIRE -------------------------------------------------
        It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, 
        and flying around and [Side-view of Toph, Aang and Katara.] making other stuff fly around. 
        I can't fly around, okay? [View of Sokka from behind.] I can't do anything.

     <!-------------------------------------- AIR --------------------------------------------------
        Remembering back to his days in the Air Temple, Aang remembers a mysterious locked door 
        that he could never quite figure out how to open. All that he remembers is that the numbers 
        (3, 2) (1, 2) (2, 3) were etched into it.
