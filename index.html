        [Angrily.] I knew it! [Accusingly points a finger at Aang as he and Katara draw closer.] 
        You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

    <!-------------------------------------- EARTH -------------------------------------------------
        [Sharply.] I'm well aware! Your eyes and tattoos glow and you're able to summon 
        unbelievable power. Without you, we'd be slaughtered before we even reach their shores. 
        [Looks at map and guides finger from the location of the base to the location of the Fire 
        Nation Capital.] But with you leading the way, as the ultimate weapon, we could cut a 
        swath right through to the heart of the Fire Nation

        It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, 
        and flying around and [Side-view of Toph, Aang and Katara.] making other stuff fly around. 
        I can't fly around, okay? [View of Sokka from behind.] I can't do anything.

     <!-------------------------------------- AIR --------------------------------------------------
        Remembering back to his days in the Air Temple, Aang remembers a mysterious locked door 
        that he could never quite figure out how to open. All that he remembers is that the numbers 
        (3, 2) (1, 2) (2, 3) were etched into it.
